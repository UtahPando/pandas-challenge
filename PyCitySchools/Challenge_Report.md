Summary Analysis
Overall, the data show that most schools have a majority of students with passing scores for both reading and math.  More concerning is that eve at the best-performing schools still nearly 10% of students do NOT have passing scores in both subjects. And and at the worst-performing handful of schools, the percent of students with failing scores for both goes math and reading is high as nearly 50%.

Conclusion #1
Funding seems to be negatively correlated with outcomes, as the best performing schools are the ones those the least funding per student, and as funding increases, scores strictly decrease. More analysis should be performed to understand this phenomenon better.

Conclusion #2
Charter schools are outperforming their District peers. In total, more than 90% of students in Charter schools received passing scores for both Math and Reading.  Meanwhile, barely more than half of students at District schools (53.7%) are passing in both subjects.
